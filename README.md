# NAME

Game::DicePoker - The Witcher's 'Dice Poker' game

# SYNOPSIS

```perl6
```

# DESCRIPTION

If you've never played
[The Witcher](http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/Witcher_Wiki), then you've wasted
your life away and I feel sorry. And if you have, then you're familiar with the
[Dice Poker](http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/Dice_poker_in_The_Witcher) minigame
and how stupidly rigged it is, once you move past the Novice players.

This distribution is an implementation of the dice poker you can play in peace,
without the meddling AI cheaters.
